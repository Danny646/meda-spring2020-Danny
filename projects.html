  <h1> Hello Welcome to this page! I hope you enjoy it. Projects Page! </h1>  

   <p>I have taken this coding course that gives me the basics of front-end, it lasts eight weeks, with the eight weeks I have  recently done  projects like a site about running/exercise and  that gives a discription of  which trails  and paths to run on. Another project  I created  prior to this class was a glutenfree page.  </p> 


   <p> I recently did the hobby site, where I talked about running, and as well paths, stated  famous ones and trails to take.   I have designed sites working with Wordpress, Drupal, and other free open source materials.  I have  worked on sites with Word Press, Drupal and so on other open source platforms where give you the the tools to build a site, frames, themes of colors, they give you an option to do it in HTML editor and as well CSS. But the thing is  it's also very limiting, they allow you to build your site but only within the open source.</p>
