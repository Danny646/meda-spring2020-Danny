            <p> Hello my  full name is Daniel Goepfert, but I go by Danny.
            I am taking this coding class to learn a general description of coding and webdesign. This is my start in coding, it has been an up and down rollercoaster ride. I started taking this class Jan 21 of  the year 2020, but I have been stuying HTML and CSS few months before this  class. <p> I hope to expand my portfolio using my class projects and see and learn outside of class. As I learn more about user x design my portfolio will updated to reflect it.   As I learn more I want to keep things more  simple and clean,  more complicated sites tend to confuse, and annoy people.  </p>
