<p> I like to run and walk at times on pathways and trails  I like them  to be convient tralves where my final destination is at that time, so I like the directions not to be complicated. 
    I don't like to feel lost so I go to places where I know and if I don't i always would keep my phone cahrged just in case I have to look at it, to find my way.  I like to run and walk on paths and trails I like the fresh breeze on my face. When I go out on a pathway It feels good when I also feel it on my face. As well, I like the drizzle of rain  hitting my body, not to be confused with heavy rain pouring down on me. I like the air warm or cold, now  to be fair I am on leveld ground in N.California, so it's not that cold, and I tend to dress for the occasion of whatever weather it's going  to be.     
    I am always aware of bikers, runners and walkers. It just feels good to at times do structured walking but at other times I like to walk aimessly when I feel no rush. Sometimes it's good to feel no rush.

    <b> <hr> <br>Here are four reasons people like to run!  </b> 
          <hr>  <br>
    <ol> 
    <li> <b>  Runner's High is a Natural High </b>  </li>   
    <i>  Within recent years, scientists discovered that the feeling of euphoria and reduced anxiety that comes with running is activated by the same part of the brain that is affected by the THC found in marijuana. Basically, scientists realized that the endorphins we get from running couldn’t pass through the blood-brain barrier on their own, so they started looking around for something else. They found that our bodies produce an endocannabinoid called anandamide that can pass through that barrier and kickstart that high — and the endocannabinoid system is the same one that gives people a high from the THC in marijuana. </i>    <li> <b> Running can be a form of meditation  </b>  </li>
                                           <i> While most of us think of meditation as quietly sitting cross-legged with our eyes closed, moving meditation can be just as effective in calming our minds. Runners focus on breathing, as does meditation. Many runners get out there to clear their minds and calm down after a stressful day. Meditation clears your mind and eases anxiety. Starting to see the connection? Meditating on the run can help you visualize your races to be more successful, connect to your pace, and build the mental strength needed to push past discomfort (something all runners are familiar with).  </i>

With run crews and meet-up groups in just about every town, it’s easy to find a running partner (or five). A good place to start is your local running store, which typically offers fun runs at least once a week. If you happen to have a friend who wants to get started in running, too, that’s even better — you’ll keep each other accountable and have fun while you’re at it!</p>      <li> <b>Exploring new Cities </b> </li>  <ol>Whether you just moved somewhere new, or you travel, running can be a great way to get your bearings in a new place. Make sure you always have your phone on you, and use MapMyRun to plot a good route (and save you from getting lost).</ol>  </ol> </i>
