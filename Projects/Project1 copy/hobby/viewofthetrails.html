The trail is primarily used for hiking, running, and nature trips.  Gertrude Trail, is another one of many trails between Phoenix Lake, just for your knowledge it's not a level, which is good to know if you have mobility issues, I personally don't, it has hills, mountains, going around the lake.</p>
