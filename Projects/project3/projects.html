   <h1> Hello Welcome to this page! I hope you enjoy it. </h1>  
              
  <p>  I recently did the hobby site, where I talked about running, and as well paths and trails to take, and mentioned some famous ones.   I have designed sites working with Wordpress, Drupal, and other free open source materials.  I have  worked on sites with Word Press, Drupal and so on other open source platforms where give you the the tools to build a site, frames, themes of colors, they give you an option to do it in HTML editor and as well CSS. But the thing is  it's also very limiting. I have taken this coding course that gives me the basics of front-end, it lasts eight weeks, with the eight weeks I have  recently done  projects like a site about running/exercise and  that gives a discription of trails to run on. Another project  I created  prior to this class was a glutenfree page.  </p>
