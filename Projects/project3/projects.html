   <h1> Hello Welcome to this page! I hope you enjoy it. </h1>  
 <p> I have  worked on sites with Word Press, Drupal and so on other open source platforms where give you the the tools to build a site, frames, themes of colors, they give you an option to do it in HTML editor and as well CSS.  But the thing is  it's also very limiting. I have taken this coding course that gives me the basics of front-end, it lasts eight weeks, with thoe eight weeks I have  recently done  projects like a site about running/exercise and  that gives a discription of trails to run on. Another project  I created was a glutenfree page. </p>                   <img src="images/IMG_2106.jpg" alt="A trail" height="154"/>

    <p> This is my start in coding,  it has been an up and down rollercoaster ride. I started taking this class Jan 21 of  the year 2020, but I have been stuying HTML and CSS few months before this  class. </p>
