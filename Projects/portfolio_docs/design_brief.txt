My name is Daniel Goepfert, I am taking this coding class to learn a general description of coding and web design.  I have done projects in the past, one of them most recently a gluten free page, others I did sites on Word press, years ago and I am excited to learn about basic coding. 

I hope to expand my portfolio using my class projects and see and learn outside of class. As I learn more about user x design my portfolio will updated to reflect it.   As I learn more I want to keep things more  simple and clean,  more complicated sites tend to confuse, and annoy people.
